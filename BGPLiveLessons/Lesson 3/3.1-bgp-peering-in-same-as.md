# iBGP Peering and Relationships

What is IBGP?
internal BGP: used to establish bgp neighbor relatioships within the same autonomous system

What are iBGP applications?
Used to share routes in transit through an autonomous system without having to do redistribution.
Used by multi-homed enterprises to ensure downstream routers can find the best ISP to use for traffic.

What are the similarities and differences between iBGP and BGP?
- similar
    - both use tcp port 179
    - both are point to point unicase connections
- differences
    - IBGP is multihop by default
    - 

What are some unique iBGP issues?
- loop prevention is done by not allowing IBGP to share routes with other IBGP routers but it can only learn routes
    - EBGP can share with IBGP routers
    - EBGP can share with other EBGP routers
- next-hop determination: in order to ensure that traffic can transit through an AS using IBGP the bgp network has to be full mesh
- IGP synchronization: used to be required because the assumption was that an IBGP session should not know any route in the internal network that the IGP doesn't know. It is not required if you have a Full IBGP mesh.
- path redundancy:if you have multiple paths through your AS then that could mean a lot of IBGP peerings. Instead use loopback address on the two edge routers and allow the IGP to know those and the rest of the net runs an IGP.
