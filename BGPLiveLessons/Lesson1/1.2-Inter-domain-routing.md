- Types of autonomous systems
- Inter-AS multi-homing
- The BGP AS_PATH attribute

The different types of autonomous systems are:
1. Single homed
2. Multi-homed
3. Stub
4. Transit

A single-homed AS may not even need BGP to send or receive routes from the ISP. It almost certainly does not need to receieve them since there is only one path out, it could use BGP to advertise its network or the ISP could use static routes to do so. 

A multi-homed AS will almost always requie BGP to help determine the best path for a particular network accorss the different service providers. 

A stub network does not serve as a conduit between other autonomous systems. Packets do not go through it to reach a destination. This may be single or multi-homed

A transit network is an autonomous system that serves as a path between other autonomous systems. It will always be running BGP. 

The BGP AS_PATH attribute:
- it is one of many path attributes. 
- it serves to determine the best path to destinations
- it is a loop prevention mechanism
- a sequence of numbers where each number represents the autonomous system of the routers that shared the route along the path. 
- the AS number is prepended to the list when the route is shared with another router. 
- if a router sees its own AS in the list, it will drop the prefix.
