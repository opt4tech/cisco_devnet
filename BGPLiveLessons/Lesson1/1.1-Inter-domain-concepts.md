Inter-domain routing protocols refers to certain routing protocol(s) that route between different autonomous systems. They are also known as External Gateway Protocols or EGPs. There is only EGP in use today called Border Gateway Protocol. 

An autonomous system is defined as a set of networks under a single administrative domain or entity. They allow the separation of administrative domains.

EGPs differ from IGPs in many ways. IGPs are routing protocols that exchange information between nodes within an autonomous system wheres EGPs exchange information between autonomous systems. 

Trusted versus untrusted peering. 

IGPs assume that all peears are trusted because they are within a single autonomous system

BGP assumes that peers are untrusted.

IGPs can look at the network hollistaclly. Link states, performance routing etc...

BGP can only look at networks from an Autonomous system path perspective and can't see the details of path information inside the AS.

BGP shares routing information very carefully. 

BGP incoming and outgoing advertisements are viewed separatley. 

BGP associate a number of path attributes to prefixes

BGPs can enable routing policies.
