# AppDynamics Instrumentation

Traditionally monitoring is very siloed. Each team/group have there own tools and those tools don't interact with each other and there is no place where the information is combined to provide a unified view into the environment. AppDynamics helps to solve this problem by giving insights into the full stack of an application. 

The AppDynamics APIs let you extend and customize various aspects of the platform. Those APIs are:
- Controller APIs - used to admin the controller, configure, monitor, query metrics, and so on
- Analytics Events API - used to send your own custom analytics events to the events service
- Standalone Machine Agent API - Available at the machine agent for uploading custom metrics
- Database Agent APIs - Used to get, create, update, and delete DB monitoring collectors
- Application Agent Instrumentation APIs - language-specific APIS to control and customize transaction detection and correlation. 
- Cloud Connector API - used to integrate cloud auto-scaling features with new platforms
