# Recovering from HTTP Errors

As I noted in section 2.1 there are recoverable and non-recoverable errors. I think of unrecoverable errors as issues that require user intervention to resolve. Recoverable errors should be manageable through code and not require user input. 

Some of examples of unrecoverable errors are:
	- 400 bad request just simply means that the request was invalid. Unless you are dealing with an api with different version and one version requires a certain request while the other another, maybe you could use this message to recover. Probably a better way to deal with that issue though. 
	- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required. Fix your auth. * might be able to recover with network based auth if you try local account after an ad account??
	- 403 Forbidden: Fix your permissions
Some examples of recoverable errors are:
	- 405 Method not allowed: incorrect method was used for accessing resource, must include a list of valid methods through the http "Allow" header. 
	- 408 timeout: Indicates a timeout, try again
429 too many requests: implement retry after timers
