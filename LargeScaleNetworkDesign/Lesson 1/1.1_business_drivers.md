# Business Drivers and Modularization

## Cost
- Capital (CAPEX)
- Operational (OPEX)

## Flexibility/Agility
- Changes with the business
- Manageable (ideally zero touch)

## Modularity

- This is the first key concentp in network design
- Can be horizontal or vertical

## Resilience
- decouples devices in different modules
- decreases mttr

## Manageability
- repeatability
- test new tech (canary concept)

It's important to remember that modularity is about creating small pieces of the total design where each piece performs a specific function and/or can be repeated over and over again but have clearly defined chokepoints/entrypoints into and out of each module. This applies to software design as well. How do we call other modules and/or pass information to other modules. The choke points are key to having a consistent place to apply policies.
