# Application and Availability

- bandwidth requirements
- minimal delay
- lower jitter

## Key Reslilience Terms
- MTBF: Mean time between failures
- MTTR: Mean time to repair
    - time until traffic is flowing
    - time until network is "as designed"
- Reliability
    - 9s of availability

## Calculations

a = uptime/(uptime + downtime(as measured))

a(proj) = uptime/(uptime + downtime(as proj))

downtime(proj) = time period/mtbf * mttr

mttr = downtime(as measured)/number of failures

## 4 Step Convergence Process
- Discover
- Report
- Calculate
- Install

*Protocol hellos follows the protocol process

*BFD hellos follows a lighter weight bfd process

*Carrier detection: interface phy/processor -> Forwarding Plane/RIB -> Protocol Process

Avialbility and reseliency has to do with how a system handles failovers and how fast it can handle those failures. Know your choke points and know your recovery mechanisims. Know what speeds to you need to achieve in recovery.
