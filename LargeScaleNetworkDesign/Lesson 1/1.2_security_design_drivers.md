# Security Drivers

Use the OODA Loop in security
- observe
    -  know what is going on and what is normal
- orient
    - understand the context and the intent
- decide
    - evaluate possible courses of action
    - decide what action to take
- act
    - do it!
    - Execute

How can this be applied to both networking and automation. What automated processes are in place to detect, decide and act.

## Enabling OODA in Design
- Choke points between modules
    - make great observation points
    - understand what is normal
    - orient to real targets/goals
- Make great decision points
    - limit which services will be impacted by actions
    - determine where to act and how
- Make great action points
    - pre-stage policy
    - focus polic at specific, identifiable points

Security needs to be a part of the design from day one. Think of your risks, your attack vectors, determine how you are going to observe at your chokepoints and determine what is normal. Decide ahead of time what policies will be put in place to ensure that the time you take to get to execution is as minimal as possible.
