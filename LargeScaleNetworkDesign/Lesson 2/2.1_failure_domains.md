# Failure Domain

All sorts of things can be considered points where different failure domains boundaries occur. It really depends on the technology. For layer 1 tech a failure domain is a single cable connection between a pc and a switch now that collision domains are no longer an issue. With hubs that failure domain is larger. For layer 2 its the broadcast domain and for Ip networks its based on modularity.

## Hide information with modularity

If your network is already designed to be modular, then you have at the chokepoints a place to hide information and create a failure domain boundary. The goal is the make changes in one module minimally impact changes in another module. In fact it should not impact the other modules at all if possible. This inlcludes vertical modules with overlays.

## Aggregation and Filtering
Summarizing routes or filtering routes when done at the choke points can help create those failure domains.

## Overlays for information hiding
Using overlays like BGP over an IGP can provide separate failure domains vertically but the BGP will still share fate with the IGP. Meaning, no IGP, no BGP. 

## Where to build choke points
- repeatability
- complexity
